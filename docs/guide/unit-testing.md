## What is BDD

BDD(Behavior-Driven Development) is a way for software teams to work that closes the gap between business people and technical people. In short, developers have implemented a suite of unit testings in source code. But other people, who don't understand code, also want to know what the developers have done. Considering of the problem, while running the unit testing, the system produces a test report, which is described in understandable natural language.
